# Release Notes v1.1.2 - Combined Filters

**Release Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Tag**: v1.1.2  
**Commits**: 37ec103, 7e33c36  
**Production URL**: https://guests-app.vercel.app

## 🎯 Overview

Version 1.1.2 introduces **Combined Filters**, enabling users to filter guests by multiple criteria simultaneously with AND logic. This was the last pending feature from v1.1.1 roadmap (Fix #6).

---

## ✨ New Features

### Combined Filters System

Users can now apply multiple filters at once to find guests more precisely:

- ✅ **Search Query** - Name, phone, address
- ✅ **Status** - Pending, Confirmed, Declined  
- ✅ **Pastor Status** - Solo Pastores, No Pastores, Todos
- ✅ **Church** - Dropdown with all unique churches from database
- ✅ **City** - Dropdown with all unique cities from database

**Logic**: All filters use **AND** operation - results match ALL active filters simultaneously.

**Example**: 
```
Status: Confirmed + Church: "Gracia Eterna" + City: "Guayana"
Result: Only confirmed guests from Gracia Eterna church in Guayana
```

## 🆕 New Components

### 1. ActiveFiltersBadges (133 lines)

Visual component showing all active filters as removable badges.

**Features**:
- Displays badge for each active filter
- Click X icon to remove individual filter
- "Limpiar todos" button to reset all filters at once
- Responsive flex-wrap layout
- Secondary variant styling for consistency
- Shows search query with preview text

**Location**: `frontend/components/ActiveFiltersBadges.tsx`

### 2. AdditionalFilters (Enhanced)

Enhanced filter component now includes city filter alongside pastor and church.

**Features**:
- Three filter dropdowns: Pastor, Church, City
- Extracts unique values dynamically from guest data
- Responsive: stacked on mobile, row on desktop
- Min-width 200px for each select
- Labels with proper accessibility

**Location**: `frontend/components/AdditionalFilters.tsx`

---

## 🐛 Hotfix Included

### SelectItem Empty Value Error (Commit 7e33c36)

**Issue**: Radix UI Select component throws error when `<SelectItem value="">` is used.

**Error Message**:
```
A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string.
```

**Solution**:
- Changed `value=""` to `value="__all__"` for "All" options
- Added conversion logic in `onValueChange` handlers
- Maintains backward compatibility with empty string in store

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/components/AdditionalFilters.tsx`

**Code Example**:
```typescript
// Before (error)
<SelectItem value=''>Todas las iglesias</SelectItem>

// After (working)
<SelectItem value='__all__'>Todas las iglesias</SelectItem>

// With conversion
<Select
  value={churchFilter || '__all__'}
  onValueChange={(value) =>
    setChurchFilter(value === '__all__' ? '' : value)
  }
>
```

---

## 🔌 Integration

### App.tsx Changes

```typescript
// Import new components
import AdditionalFilters from './components/AdditionalFilters';
import ActiveFiltersBadges from './components/ActiveFiltersBadges';

// Get filters from store
const {
  isPastorFilter,
  cityFilter,
  churchFilter,
} = useUIStore();

// Pass to useGuests hook
const { data: guestsData } = useGuests({
  page: currentPage,
  limit: pageSize,
  search: searchQuery,
  status: statusFilter === 'ALL' ? undefined : statusFilter,
  sortBy,
  sortOrder,
  // Combined filters
  isPastor: isPastorFilter !== null ? isPastorFilter : undefined,
  city: cityFilter || undefined,
  church: churchFilter || undefined,
});
```

### UI Integration

Components are rendered after StatusFilter:

```tsx
<StatusFilter />
<AdditionalFilters />      {/* New: Pastor, Church, City filters */}
<ActiveFiltersBadges />    {/* New: Visual badges of active filters */}
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### Build Performance
- **Build Time**: 4.46s (optimized with Vite cache)
- **Total Deployment**: 8s
- **Bundle Size**: 
  - Main JS: 247.56 kB (gzip: 70.12 kB)
  - CSS: 57.95 kB (gzip: 10.02 kB)
  - Total: ~305 kB (gzip: ~80 kB)

### Modules
- **Total Modules**: 1990 (transformed)

### Breaking Changes
- **None** - Fully backward compatible

### Known Issues

---

## 🔄 State Management

Filters are managed through Zustand store (`uiStore.ts`):

```typescript
interface UIStore {
  isPastorFilter: boolean | null;  // null = all, true = pastors, false = non-pastors
  cityFilter: string;                // empty string = all cities
  churchFilter: string;              // empty string = all churches
  
  setIsPastorFilter: (isPastor: boolean | null) => void;
  setCityFilter: (city: string) => void;
  setChurchFilter: (church: string) => void;
}
```

All filter changes reset `currentPage` to 1 for better UX.
